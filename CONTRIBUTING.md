## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow the standard Rust formatting (run `cargo fmt`)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add documentation for public APIs
- Include tests for new functionality

### Commit Messages

- Use clear and descriptive commit messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less

### Pull Requests

- Fill out the pull request template completely
- Include tests for new features or bug fixes
- Update documentation if necessary
- Ensure all CI checks pass

### Issues

When reporting bugs or requesting features:

- Use the appropriate issue template
- Provide as much detail as possible
- Include code examples when relevant
- Check for existing issues before creating new ones

## Feature Development

When adding new features:

1. **Discuss first**: For significant changes, open an issue to discuss the approach
2. **Start small**: Break large features into smaller, reviewable chunks
3. **Test thoroughly**: Include unit tests and integration tests
4. **Document**: Update README.md and add doc comments
5. **Maintain compatibility**: Avoid breaking changes when possible

## Testing

We use several types of tests:

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and modules
- **Integration tests**: Test feature interactions
- **Doc tests**: Ensure code examples in documentation work
- **Feature tests**: Test different feature combinations

## Documentation

- Use `///` for public API documentation
- Include examples in documentation when helpful
- Update the README.md for user-facing changes
- Add entries to CHANGELOG.md

## Release Process

Releases are handled by maintainers:

1. Update version in `Cargo.toml`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Create a git tag
4. GitHub Actions automatically publishes to crates.io

## Getting Help
